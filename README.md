# Practical Projects of Microprocessed Systems Course
The course seeks to understand the functioning of microcontrollers in general and their resources (timers, LEDS, operation profiles, etc).
Hence, at this semester, 2019.1, we will do all practical projects using the MSP430FR5994 microcontroller.
Finally, this course is divided into 3 modules and a final project.



## Final project - Flasher Bluetooth Control System
Elaboration of remotely controlled Christmas tree flasher control system controlled
remotely by the cell phone via Bluetooth connection. The functionalities present are:
changing the frequency of the blinker and changing the animation (alternating,
simultaneous and pulsating LEDs).
